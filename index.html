<h1>Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
<b>Major Pieces of the Web</b>
<p>
  The web consists of 4 components: users, a computer with a browser, the internet, and servers.<br>
  <br>The browser makes a request, via the internet, to servers.  The internet communicates with the servers using HTTP.  The servers respond with files which the browser displays.<br>
  <br>See <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">this video</a> for a more in depth explanation of the web.
</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>
  HTML is short for "HyperText Markup Language".  HTML consists of text content, markup (tags and elements), references to other documents (images and video) and links.<br>
  <br>A few examples of tags are bold, italics, anchor (for links) and image (this is a <em>void</em> tag- doesnt require a closing tag).<br>
  <br>Tags can also have attributes.  For instance, the anchor tag has the attribute href.  This is used for creating links.  Image tags have the attributes src (for url) and alt (for text when image doesnt load).
</p>
<b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
<p>
  &lt;br&gt; (line break) is an inline element while &lt;p&gt; is a block element.  Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.<br>
  <br>Span is inline while Div is a block element.  These elements don't do anything besides contain content, but you can attach styles to them to affect the display of the content.  You do this by adding CSS classes.
